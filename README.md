# FriskyBreaks
FriskyBreaks is a cross-platform, sleek, minimalist break scheduler inspired by the Pomodoro technique.

## This is why you should switch to using FriskyBreaks!
* A sexy night mode
* Taskbar icon notifications, just like Discord
* Annoyed by sound notifications? Can't find the mute button? No problem. We don't have any sounds :)

## Wish to partake in the code writing?
* Qt 5.15.1
* MinGW 8.1.0 (64-bit)
* C++11
