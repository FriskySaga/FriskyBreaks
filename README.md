FriskyBreaks is a cross-platform, sleek, minimalist break scheduler inspired by the Pomodoro technique.

## This is why you should switch to using FriskyBreaks!
* A sexy night mode
* Taskbar icon notifications, just like Discord
* Annoyed by sound notifications? Can't find the mute button? No problem. We don't have any sounds :)

## Wish to partake in the code writing?
* Qt 5.15.1
* MinGW 8.1.0 (64-bit)
* C++11

## Afterword
From January 2020 through April 2020, I wrote 800 lines of spaghetti JavaFX code. Disgusted with the unmaintainability and jankiness of it all, I privatized the repository and put FriskyBreaks on the shelf. [My application did work](https://www.patreon.com/posts/friskybreaks-1-5-35655407), but I wasn't proud of it. In fact, I didn't even use my own software! What an embarassment, even if it was my first JavaFX application. But the motivation to work with JavaFX came from the fact that I had a Java textbook from college that I had never read, and so I thought then and there would be a perfect opportunity to use that as a resource! Maybe another day...

Then in September 2020, I picked up the project again. I am not a web developer, and my day job doesn't give me an oppoortunity to grow my skills in that area. So I thought I would use this project as a stepping stone towards expanding my web development skills. After all, Electron apps are pretty stylish, even if they use a lot of memory. As I wrote my first Electron app, I felt uneasy every time I glanced at Task Manager and observed the amount of memory that Firefox was using. Almost on a whim, I decided to wipe out my Electron prototype work.

I am a Python/C++ developer after all. Why can't I use Qt? [I've had amazing success with PyQt in college](https://github.com/imlasky/LightMap). But it's true that I've never written any real Qt code before, so I'm going to try that next.
